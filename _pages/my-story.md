Hi. I'm Bulut. Turker Bulut. Kind of like "Bond. James Bond." Except... I am real :) 

I built a website because ... uhhh.. it's always been on my mind. Really 

Test

I am going to write like I have never written before. I got 750 words to get to. No pressure. No judgment of how bad the thoughts might be. Just keep writing, the instructions say. 

Okaayy.. Let's hink about what I want to get out of my head. Hmm. Maybe my latest intereaction with Leslie's dad. He is pretty conservative and border-line racist. He just talked to me about politics and on issues that I don't necessarily agree with him. Leslie came and interrupted. I remained silent. I din't know what to say to be honest.. Part of me felt like I wish i knew more. I wish I knew what to say. But I didn't. Is it even my place to comment on American politics? you could argue that it's not. I don't even have a vote. You could also argue that I must comment. At the end of the day, I work here, I live here. I contribute to the economy here. My work touches lives here. AMerican policies affect me. 

Part of the silence is also lack of hope. Would it even make a difference? Leslie fights with him, has heated debates. Doesn't go anywhere. So, it doesn't matter.
